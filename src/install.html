    <h1>Welcome to Metasearch!</h1>
    <p>Metasearch is a meta-search engine in the form of an extension. It
    aggregates results from online search engines, that can either be general
    (such as DuckDuckGo) or domain-specific (such as IMDb). All of these
    results are fetched through your browser (as separate tabs opened by the
    extension), so there is no centralized "Metasearch" service. This means
    that you are no more anonymous than if you were directly accessing these
    websites, but it also makes it very easy to access login-bound search
    engines such as library websites.</p>
    <p>Metasearch can be accessed by clicking the browser-action button on the
    top-right. It is also added as a search engine, and you can set it as the
    default. To edit search engines, navigate to the
    <a href='options.html'>options page</a> by either clicking the link next to
    the search bar, or going to the addon preferences (about:addons &rarr;
    click on metasearch &rarr; Preferences in Firefox). To add search engines,
    it is recommended to use the graphical helper. Perform a search on any
    website, and then right-click on the Metasearch icon &rarr; Add current
    page as engine.</p>
    <p>In order to improve user experience, each engine is associated with a
    set of aliases and keywords (configured through the options page). Aliases
    (such as ddg for DuckDuckGo) enable the associated engines and are removed
    from the search query. If the search query contains any aliases, only the
    engines that contain at least one of these aliases are queried. Different
    engines may share aliases (both Merriam-Webster and Wiktionary share the
    "define" alias), and the same engine may have multiple aliases (IMDb has
    the aliases "movie", "tv", and "imdb"). Keywords (such as "python" for
    StackOverflow) enable the associated engines but are not removed from the
    search query. The star (*) keyword matches all queries (enabled by default
    for DuckDuckGo and Wikipedia). If an engine's keywords exist in the query,
    but its alias doesn't it will only be queried if the query does not contain
    any aliases.</p>
    <p>Below are some queries for you to try out the default search engines.
    Aliases are colored in green, while keywords are colored in red.</p>
